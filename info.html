				<h2>History of Chess</h2>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Origins in India</h3>
					<p>
						The earliest precursors of chess originated in ancient
						India during the Gupta Empire. The game was known as
						chaturanga, which means "four divisions of the military"
						in Sanskrit. These four divisions were represented in
						the game: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.
					</p>

				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Game Spreads to Persia</h3>
					<p>
						From India, chess spread to Persia. The Persians renamed
						the game chatrang. Under the Sasanian Empire, chatrang
						became a popular pastime among the nobility. The rules
						were refined, the number of pieces and board size were
						standardized, and chess strategy grew in sophistication.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Game Moves to Arabia and Europe</h3>
					<p>
						The Islamic Golden Age saw chess spread from Persia to
						the Arab world. The Moors introduced chess to Spain
						during the early 8th century, and from there it spread
						throughout Western Europe. Various European languages
						adopted versions of the Persian name, with "checkmate"
						coming from "shah mat" meaning "the king is helpless".
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Chess Becomes a Game of Skill</h3>
					<p>
						In Europe, chess transitioned from a dice-based game of
						chance to a game of pure skill during the 15th century.
						Additional rules were created, moves were restricted,
						and the queen and bishop pieces gained their modern
						powers. The modern rules of chess were established in
						the late 15th and early 16th centuries.

					<h3>Chess Gains Popularity</h3>
					<p>
						By the 19th century, chess had become widely popular
						among people of the middle and upper classes in Europe
						and the Americas. Official world chess championships
						began in 1886. The 20th century saw the rise of
						grandmasters, opening theories, and chess engines.
						Today, chess remains a massively popular game and
						competitive sport around the world. Advancements in AI
						have even enabled chess programs that can defeat human
						grandmasters.

				<h2>How to Play Chess</h2>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Basics</h3>
					<p>
						Chess is played between two opponents on opposite sides
						of a board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each
						player controls 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2
						bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The objective is to
						checkmate the other king by placing it under an
						inescapable threat.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Board</h3>
					<p>
						Each type of piece moves differently. The king can move
						one square in any direction. The queen can move any
						number of squares in any straight line horizontally,
						vertically, or diagonally. Rooks can move any number of
						squares horizontally or vertically. Bishops can move any
						number of squares diagonally. Knights move two squares
						horizontally then one square vertically, or two squares
						vertically then one square horizontally. Pawns can only
						move forward one square at a time, except for their
						first move where they can move two squares.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Pieces</h3>
					<p>
						On each turn, a player moves one of their pieces to a
						different square following the movement rules of that
						piece. All pieces capture opponent pieces by moving to
						the square occupied by the other piece. The captured
						piece is then removed from the board. Checkmate occurs
						when the king is under immediate attack and cannot avoid
						capture. Stalemate is when a player cannot move their
						pieces. Either player can capture the other's pieces
						according to movement rules.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Ending</h3>
					<p>
						Players take turns moving one of their pieces. A game
						can end in checkmate, stalemate, or forfeit. If there is
						a capture threat, the defending player must get out of
						check. Double check or triple check is when there are
						multiple simultaneous threats. Perpetual check leads to
						a draw. Knights, bishops, and pawns cannot move to their
						same color complex if they have already moved to a
						different color complex.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Order / Professional Etiquette</h3>
					<p>
						White always moves first. Pieces can only move clockwise
						from their current position. Playing white has an
						advantage, but a skilled chess player can win with
						either color. Players should keep track of pieces
						captured to determine the difference in points between
						the sides. More points means an advantage toward the
						endgame.

				<h2>Winning Chess Strategies</h2>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Control the center early.</h3>
					<p>
						Place pawns and pieces in the center four squares of the
						board to gain an advantage. The center provides greater
						mobility and access to more of the board.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Use all your pieces.</h3>
					<p>
						Don't just rely on the queen and more powerful pieces.
						Knights, bishops, and pawns also have an important role
						to play. Coordinating all your pieces creates threats
						that are hard for the opponent to defend against.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Think before each move.</h3>
					<p>
						Evaluate all possible moves and consider your opponent's
						responses. Try to set up "if-then" sequences by
						imagining what your opponent may play and how you will
						counter it. Each move should have a purpose.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article class="card">
					<h3>Protect your king.</h3>
					<p>
						Castle early to keep your king safe and connect your
						rooks. Be very careful about moving your king in the
						opening and middlegame. Don't leave it exposed or in
						open lines of attack.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article class="card">
					<h3>Gain a material advantage.</h3>
					<p>
						Try to capture opponent pieces in a way that gives you a
						net point gain while keeping the balance of power on the
						board. A material advantage gives you more attacking and
						defensive possibilities. But avoid just trading pieces
						without improving your position.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article class="card">
					<h3>Maintain the initiative.</h3>
					<p>
						Force your opponent to respond to threats by creating
						attacks and weakening their position. When you have the
						initiative, you control the flow of the game and have
						more attacking chances. Seize the opportunity to launch
						an assault when your opponent makes a mistake.
					</p>
				</article>

				<article class="card">
					<h3>Anticipate opponent threats.</h3>
					<p>
						Look for opportunities where your opponent could capture
						one of your pieces or launch an attack. Then, develop
						moves that counter those possible threats, forcing your
						opponent to abandon them. Always be one step ahead.
