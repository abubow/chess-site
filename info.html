			<h1>History of Chess</h1>
			<p>
				Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a
				chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an
				eight-by-eight grid. Chess is played by millions of people
				worldwide, both amateurs and professionals. Each player begins
				the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two
				knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece
				types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture
				the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 'checkmate' the
				opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of
				capture. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by the
				voluntary resignation of the opponent, which typically occurs
				when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears
				unavoidable. A game may result in a draw in several ways. Chess
				is believed to have originated in India, before 600 AD. The
				earliest known predecessor of chess may be the Indian game
				chaturanga, which was developed around the 6th century AD. The
				game chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern
				strategy games xiangqi, janggi and shogi. Chess reached Europe
				by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The
				pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th
				century; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.
				During the 20th century, chess became a recognized sport with
				international governing bodies, and the game's global popularity
				helped fuel a surge in tournament chess. The first World Chess
				Championship, officially recognised by FIDE, took place in 1886
				with Wilhelm Steinitz defeating Johannes Zukertort. Since 1948,
				the World Championship has been controlled by FIDE; the current
				World Champion is Magnus Carlsen. The highest official rating a
				chess player can achieve is 2850. There are many variants of
				chess. Three of the most popular are chess960, the
				correspondence game, and chess problems. Chess has been a part
				of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1972.
				The World Chess Championship has been conducted since 1886,
				although the tournament format was not established until 1921.
				The game is popular in schools, where it can improve
				concentration, logic, and reasoning skills. Chess is also
				popular among the general public, with recreational players of
				all ages and abilities.
